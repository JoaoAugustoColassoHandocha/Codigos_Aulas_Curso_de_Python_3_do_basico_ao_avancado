# My Journey to Learning Python

 This repository records my discoveries on my Python learning journey, through the classes of the **Python 3 Course from Basic to Advanced**, on the **Udemy** platform.

 My motivation for creating this repository is to have a single place to store solutions to problems I have encountered and to find them easily.
 
 If these solutions can help others, I'll be happy to share them.

 Another motivation for creating this repository is to keep track of my areas of limited knowledge, which will encourage me to explore certain subjects in more depth, while also providing explanations on more basic topics.
